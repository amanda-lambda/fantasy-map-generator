# fantasy-map-generator
Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce awesome looking fantasy maps

## Overview
Inspired by Progressive Growing of GANs paper, but modified extensively for this use case. Utilizes a progressively growing architecture, WGAN-GP loss, to generate 512x512 fantasy maps.

## Running the code


## Generating the dataset
I used the Selenium IDE to build the dataset of fantasy maps. Credits to @mewo2, who built the map generator I used to build the dataset. 
Google Drive link to the dataset: TBD
